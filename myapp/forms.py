# if we are making a database driven app we need to make forms
from django import forms

#Forinstance, you might have a BlogComment model, and you want to create a form that lets people submit comments.
#In this case, it would  be redundant to define the field types in your form, because youâ€™ve already defined the fields in your model.
# for this we import files from models.py
from models import UserModel, PostModel, LikeModel, CommentModel

# forms are created using classes which consists of fields that are to be displayed in web pages
